# WorkPace Prototypes

WorkPace Technology LLC is a general purpose company I started for creating products designed to bring a **_change of pace to your online workspace_**.

## Roadmap

- [x] Integrate Auth0 Auth Provider with Next-Auth, allowing users to create accounts. Add RBAC to restruct content by role.
- [x] Setup Notion and OpenAI SDK's, sending formatted notion task data to a ChatGPT prompt.
- [ ] Setup a hosted Java API service, which queries a postgres database, for a functional comment section.

## Feature Prototypes

### The Good Stuff List

Enables me to create valuable artifacts, such as year-end reviews, resume sections, and LinkedIn experience descriptions by feeding my accomplishments (task tracking in Notion) into OpenAI's GPT models.
