# The Good Stuff List 📝

The worst thing you can do in a performance review is let your story be told by
someone else.

Only you are capable of framing all of the things you have done, especially in
terms of their impact. Public acknowledgments, kudos, thank you notes,
mentorships, organizing team meetings ... no one is tracking this for you.

When you go to your performance review and ask for that big raise, they aren't
going to give it to you unless you lay out why you deserve it. You need
evidence, context, and a clear narrative of your contributions.

Keep a good stuff list. You'll thank me later.
